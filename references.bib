  abstract = {This paper applies topology optimisation to the design of structures with periodic and layered microstructural details without length scale separation, i.e. considering the complete macroscopic structure and its response, while resolving all microstructural details, as compared to the often used homogenisation approach. The approach takes boundary conditions into account and ensures connected and macroscopically optimised microstructures regardless of the difference in micro- and macroscopic length scales. This results in microstructures tailored for specific applications rather than specific properties. Manufacturability is further ensured by the use of robust topology optimisation. Dealing with the complete macroscopic structure and its response is computationally challenging as very fine discretisations are needed in order to resolve all microstructural details. Therefore, this paper shows the benefits of applying a contrast-independent spectral preconditioner based on the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) to large structures with fully-resolved microstructural details. It is shown that a single preconditioner can be reused for many design iterations and used for several design realisations, in turn leading to massive savings in computational cost. The density-based topology optimisation approach combined with a Heaviside projection filter and a stochastic robust formulation is used on various problems, with both periodic and layered microstructures. The presented approach is shown to allow for the topology optimisation of very large problems in Matlab, specifically a problem with 26 million displacement degrees of freedom in 26 hours using a single computational thread.},

  abstract = {In additive manufacturing process, support structures are often required to ensure the quality of the final built part. In this article, we present mathematical models and their numerical implementations in an optimization loop, which allow us to design optimal support structures. Our models are derived with the requirement that they should be as simple as possible, computationally cheap, and, yet, based on a realistic physical modelling. Supports are optimized with respect to two different physical properties. First, they must support overhanging regions of the structure for improving the stiffness of the supported structure during the building process. Second, supports can help in channeling the heat flux produced by the source term (typically a laser beam) and thus improving the cooling down of the structure during the fabrication process. Of course, more involved constraints or manufacturability conditions could be taken into account, most notably removal of supports. Our work is just a first step, proposing a general framework for support optimization. Our optimization algorithm is based on the level set method and on the computation of shape derivatives by the Hadamard method. In a first approach, only the shape and topology of the supports are optimized, for a given and fixed structure. In a second and more elaborated strategy, both the supports and the structure are optimized, which amounts to a specific multiphase optimization problem. Numerical examples are given in 2D and 3D.},

The main idea is to optimize the homogenized formulation of this problem, which is an easy task of parametric optimization, then to project the optimal microstructure at a desired lengthscale, which is a delicate issue, albeit computationally cheap. The main novelty of our work is, in a plane setting, the conformal treatment of the optimal orientation of the microstructure. In other words, although the periodicity cell has varying parameters and orientation throughout the computational domain, the angles between its members or bars are conserved. The main application of our work is the optimization of so-called lattice materials which are becoming increasingly popular in the context of additive manufacturing.

Finite element implementations generate practical designs that are convergent with respect to grid refinement. Thus, an arbitrary level of geometric resolution can be achieved, so single-step procedures for topology design and detailed shape design are possible. The perimeter method eliminates the need for relaxation, thereby circumventing many of the complexities and restrictions of other approaches to topology design.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization (TO) is an optimal design method to obtain an efficient structure with minimal usage of material by satisfying two conflicting objectives of weight reduction and structural safety. Owing to the recent advances in additive manufacturing technology, TO has been developed in connection with the use of microscale lattices, of which complicated geometries require considerable computational loads to verify their structural performance. This study aims to develop an efficient computational method to analyze a complex TO model. Computational homogenization was then developed for efficient computation of the TO model that contains a number of microscale lattices. The proposed homogenization scheme was then applied to perform three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) on various TO models with three scales (i.e., macroscale, microscale, and multiscale TOs). The homogenized FEAs were conducted to verify the static and dynamic deformation behaviors of three optimized meta-sandwich beams, and their results and computational efficiency were compared with those from full solid FEAs. Experimental verification revealed that the proposed homogenized FEA provided more reliable results and better computational efficiency for the microscale and multiscale TO models, whereas the conventional solid FEA was advantageous for the macroscale TO model. To apply the proposed simulation strategy to a more complex 3D geometry, three TO models were calculated for a 3D block under a compression load. The simulation strategy combining the full solid and homogenized FEAs was then applied to analyze the static and dynamic deformation behaviors of various TO models, which provided reliable predictions of the experimentally observed behaviors within an acceptable computational time.},

Functionally graded composites are inhomogeneous materials with continuously varying spatial composition. The spatial variation in material properties might enable better performance than an isotropic multi-material structure or fiber-reinforced composite structure with fixed fiber volume fraction. In order to enable the simultaneous design of composite topology, spatially varying fiber material layout and orientation, a homogenization design method (HDM) is applied together with a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method taking into account the advantage of each method. The SIMP method is efficient in determining discrete material states while avoiding intermediate states. Thus, it is applied to determine whether a material is void or a composite state. The HDM allows intermediate material states because it considers true anisotropic composite materials. Taking this advantage, the HDM method is applied to optimize spatially varying anisotropic fiber material layout and orientation. The optimization result of the fiber material is visualized using the projection method proposed for periodic composite structures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical examples for compliance minimization problems are provided.},

This offers exciting opportunities for innovative designs, and particularly topology optimization has been identified as a key technique to fully exploit the capabilities of AM. However, also AM involves manufacturing restrictions, such as limitations on the inclination of overhanging parts. To deal with this problem, either sacrificial supporting structures can be added during the process, or only self-supporting designs can be considered. Both approaches have disadvantages, as support structures add material and post-processing costs, while demanding exclusively self-supporting designs may impose strong restrictions on achievable performance. With current methods, designers are limited to a choice between these two extremes. To open up a wider range of designs, this paper presents and demonstrates a topology optimization formulation that allows the designer to find trade-off solutions between design performance and support structure costs, considering both printing and removal costs},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to apply a Helmholtz-type partial differential equation as an alternative to standard density filtering in topology optimization problems. Previously, this approach has been successfully applied as a sensitivity filter. The usual filtering techniques in topology optimization require information about the neighbor cells, which is difficult to obtain for fine meshes or complex domains and geometries. The complexity of the problem increases further in parallel computing, when the design domain is decomposed into multiple non-overlapping partitions. Obtaining information from the neighbor subdomains is an expensive operation. The proposed filter technique requires only mesh information necessary for the finite element discretization of the problem. The main idea is to define the filtered variable implicitly as a solution of a Helmholtz-type differential equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The properties of the filter are demonstrated for various 2D and 3D topology optimization problems in linear elasticity, solved on serial and parallel computers.

However, existing simultaneous optimization techniques are limited, with most methods requiring cumbersome procedures to pre-define support conditions, which may not be easy for the end-users. This study presents a new element-based simultaneous optimization method by introducing a layer of elements to the boundaries where supports are allowed, which can be simply implemented in finite element (FE) models. Computational algorithms are developed based on a combination of an optimality criteria (OC) method and the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique to determine support locations and the structural topology, respectively. A variety of examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. It is found that the number, position, and stiffness of supports may significantly influence the structural topology. A support location analysis is used to validate the new method and confirms optimal designs. This study shows that treating element-based support locations as additional design variables can effectively obtain efficient and innovative structural designs. Two 3D examples are presented to demonstrate potential practical applications of the new method.},

  abstract = {Total knee replacement (TKR) is considered as one of the most success among clinical interventions for patients with who suffering from knee osteoarthritis (OA). We sought to estimate the incidence of TKR using demographics, incidence rates, lengths of hospital stay, and costs from 1996 to 2010 by analyzing Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 154,553 patients obtained primary TKR surgery between 1996 and 2010. The diagnosis code for knee OA and the procedure code for TKR were selected from the records. To compare the rate of TKR between covariables, we calculated the TKR risk ratios and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of these variables (gender, age, age group, and primary diagnoses). A 2-tailed P-value of .05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical package SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to conduct all the statistical analyzes. We analyzed 154,553 TKRs performed by surgeons in Taiwan from 1996 to 2010. The overall crude incidence increased from 26.4 to 74.55 TKR per 100,000 inhabitants from 1996 to 2010. TKR incidence for the 70 to 79 years age group increased from 227 to 505 per 100,000 people from 1996 to 2010. The age-standardized rate ratios for TKR of women to men ranged from 2.5 to 3.0. The mean average length of stay in hospital was 15 days in 1996 and decreased to 8 days in 2010. During the study period, the adjusted mean cost per patient decreased from US\$7485 to US\$4827. Health expenditures for TKR were 5\% of total National Health Insurance expenditure every year. Over the 15-year period, Taiwan's TKR incidence tripled, which is consistent with population ageing. Arthritis will be a major public health issue in the ageing population in the future.},

  abstract = {In this work, an in house topology optimization (TO) solver is developed to optimize a conjugate heat transfer problem: realizing more complex and efficient coolant systems by minimizing pressure losses and maximizing the heat transfer. The TO method consists in an idealized sedimentation process in which a design variable, in this case impermeability, is iteratively updated across the domain. The optimal solution is the solidified region uniquely defined by the final distribution of impermeability. Due to the geometrical complexity of the optimal solutions obtained, this design method is not always suitable for classic manufacturing methods (molding, stamping....) On the contrary, it can be thought as an approach to better and fully exploit the flexibility offered by additive manufacturing (AM), still often used on old and less efficient design techniques. In the present article, the proposed method is developed using a Lagrangian optimization approach to minimize stagnation pressure dissipation while maximizing heat transfer between fluid and solid region. An impermeability dependent thermal conductivity is included and a smoother operator is adopted to bound thermal diffusivity gradients across solid and fluid. Simulations are performed on a straight squared duct domain. The variability of the results is shown on the basis of different weights of the objective functions. The solver builds automatically three-dimensional structures enhancing the heat transfer level between the walls and the flow through the generation of pairs of counter rotating vortices. This is consistent to solution proposed in literature like v-shaped ribs, even if the geometry generated is more complex and more efficient. It is possible to define the desired level of heat transfer and losses and obtain the closest optimal solution. It is the first time that a conjugate heat transfer optimization problem, with these constraints, has been tackled with this approach for three-dimensional geometries.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Although additive manufacturing (AM) continues to gain widespread adoption, the overhang problem remains a critical issue affecting printing quality. The design of self-supporting structures via topology optimisation approaches has been extensively studied. However, current optimisation research predominantly focuses on 3-axis AM machines, overlooking the more recently developed multi-axis machines. Moreover, the performance sacrifice due to overhang constraints in 3-axis AM can be significant, especially in structures with small volume fractions. To address this, we propose a two-step approach considering overhang constraints for multi-axis AM. This approach begins with a structure optimised using traditional topology optimisation. In the first step, a new optimisation problem determines printing surfaces for the given structure. If the proportion of unprintable elements isn't satisfactory, a second re-optimisation step is carried out to further reduce the unprintable proportion. Several examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Notably, the significant performance sacrifice associated with the 3-axis AM approach becomes negligible when applying our multi-axis AM-based method.},

The process model is seamlessly integrated into a density based structural topology optimization method with an adjoint based sensitivity analysis and a gradient based optimization. For a given prototype shape, the layout of the corresponding support structure is designed such that the thermal energy during the fabrication process can be efficiently transferred from the laser path to a prescribed heat sink. Besides, an overhang constraint is proposed and used together with an AM filter to avoid overhang features in both the optimized support structure and the prototype, ensuring the overall manufacturability.
