  abstract = {In additive manufacturing process, support structures are often required to ensure the quality of the final built part. In this article, we present mathematical models and their numerical implementations in an optimization loop, which allow us to design optimal support structures. Our models are derived with the requirement that they should be as simple as possible, computationally cheap, and, yet, based on a realistic physical modelling. Supports are optimized with respect to two different physical properties. First, they must support overhanging regions of the structure for improving the stiffness of the supported structure during the building process. Second, supports can help in channeling the heat flux produced by the source term (typically a laser beam) and thus improving the cooling down of the structure during the fabrication process. Of course, more involved constraints or manufacturability conditions could be taken into account, most notably removal of supports. Our work is just a first step, proposing a general framework for support optimization. Our optimization algorithm is based on the level set method and on the computation of shape derivatives by the Hadamard method. In a first approach, only the shape and topology of the supports are optimized, for a given and fixed structure. In a second and more elaborated strategy, both the supports and the structure are optimized, which amounts to a specific multiphase optimization problem. Numerical examples are given in 2D and 3D.},

This study presents a repulsion index (RI), which satisfies the easy removal requirement and minimizes the number of artifacts left on the specimen surface, and a weighting function, which quantifies the cost incurred by the time taken to build the supports. A multi-objective topological optimization based on the simple isotropic material with penalization method, continuous approximation of material distribution, and method of moving asymptotes is formulated that includes the proposed RI and cost formulation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that rational support layouts can be determined with the proposed cost-based formulation in the topological optimization, allowing designers to find design solutions with a compromise between specimen surface profile error and support structure costs.},

  abstract = {Advances in additive manufacturing (AM) allow economical production of components with unprecedented geometric complexity. This offers exciting opportunities for innovative designs, and particularly topology optimization has been identified as a key technique to fully exploit the capabilities of AM. However, also AM involves manufacturing restrictions, such as limitations on the inclination of overhanging parts. To deal with this problem, either sacrificial supporting structures can be added during the process, or only self-supporting designs can be considered. Both approaches have disadvantages, as support structures add material and post-processing costs, while demanding exclusively self-supporting designs may impose strong restrictions on achievable performance. With current methods, designers are limited to a choice between these two extremes. To open up a wider range of designs, this paper presents and demonstrates a topology optimization formulation that allows the designer to find trade-off solutions between design performance and support structure costs, considering both printing and removal costs},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to apply a Helmholtz-type partial differential equation as an alternative to standard density filtering in topology optimization problems. Previously, this approach has been successfully applied as a sensitivity filter. The usual filtering techniques in topology optimization require information about the neighbor cells, which is difficult to obtain for fine meshes or complex domains and geometries. The complexity of the problem increases further in parallel computing, when the design domain is decomposed into multiple non-overlapping partitions. Obtaining information from the neighbor subdomains is an expensive operation. The proposed filter technique requires only mesh information necessary for the finite element discretization of the problem. The main idea is to define the filtered variable implicitly as a solution of a Helmholtz-type differential equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The properties of the filter are demonstrated for various 2D and 3D topology optimization problems in linear elasticity, solved on serial and parallel computers.

  abstract = {Topology optimization techniques are typically performed on a design domain with pre-determined support conditions to generate efficient structures. Allowing the optimizer to simultaneously design supports and topology offers new design possibilities to achieve improved structural performance and reduce the cost of supports. However, existing simultaneous optimization techniques are limited, with most methods requiring cumbersome procedures to pre-define support conditions, which may not be easy for the end-users. This study presents a new element-based simultaneous optimization method by introducing a layer of elements to the boundaries where supports are allowed, which can be simply implemented in finite element (FE) models. Computational algorithms are developed based on a combination of an optimality criteria (OC) method and the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique to determine support locations and the structural topology, respectively. A variety of examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. It is found that the number, position, and stiffness of supports may significantly influence the structural topology. A support location analysis is used to validate the new method and confirms optimal designs. This study shows that treating element-based support locations as additional design variables can effectively obtain efficient and innovative structural designs. Two 3D examples are presented to demonstrate potential practical applications of the new method.},

  abstract = {Total knee replacement (TKR) is considered as one of the most success among clinical interventions for patients with who suffering from knee osteoarthritis (OA). We sought to estimate the incidence of TKR using demographics, incidence rates, lengths of hospital stay, and costs from 1996 to 2010 by analyzing Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 154,553 patients obtained primary TKR surgery between 1996 and 2010. The diagnosis code for knee OA and the procedure code for TKR were selected from the records. To compare the rate of TKR between covariables, we calculated the TKR risk ratios and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of these variables (gender, age, age group, and primary diagnoses). A 2-tailed P-value of .05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical package SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to conduct all the statistical analyzes. We analyzed 154,553 TKRs performed by surgeons in Taiwan from 1996 to 2010. The overall crude incidence increased from 26.4 to 74.55 TKR per 100,000 inhabitants from 1996 to 2010. TKR incidence for the 70 to 79 years age group increased from 227 to 505 per 100,000 people from 1996 to 2010. The age-standardized rate ratios for TKR of women to men ranged from 2.5 to 3.0. The mean average length of stay in hospital was 15 days in 1996 and decreased to 8 days in 2010. During the study period, the adjusted mean cost per patient decreased from US\$7485 to US\$4827. Health expenditures for TKR were 5\% of total National Health Insurance expenditure every year. Over the 15-year period, Taiwan's TKR incidence tripled, which is consistent with population ageing. Arthritis will be a major public health issue in the ageing population in the future.},

  abstract = {Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most effective, cost-efficient, and consistently successful surgeries in orthopedics. Patient-reported outcomes underscore its significant impact on pain relief, functional restoration, and improved quality of life. TKA provides reliable outcomes for patients with end-stage, tricompartmental, or degenerative osteoarthritis.~Considering osteoarthritis affects millions of people in the United States, the knee~bears the~brunt of this progressive~condition, which is characterized by a gradual degeneration and loss of articular cartilage. Estimates indicate an annual incidence of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis at 240 per 100,000 patients, with approximately 400,000 primary TKA surgeries performed annually in the United States. Although~primary osteoarthritis is the most common clinical diagnosis associated with TKA, other~potential underlying diagnoses include inflammatory arthritis, fracture (posttraumatic osteoarthritis or deformity), dysplasia, and malignancy.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Although additive manufacturing (AM) continues to gain widespread adoption, the overhang problem remains a critical issue affecting printing quality. The design of self-supporting structures via topology optimisation approaches has been extensively studied. However, current optimisation research predominantly focuses on 3-axis AM machines, overlooking the more recently developed multi-axis machines. Moreover, the performance sacrifice due to overhang constraints in 3-axis AM can be significant, especially in structures with small volume fractions. To address this, we propose a two-step approach considering overhang constraints for multi-axis AM. This approach begins with a structure optimised using traditional topology optimisation. In the first step, a new optimisation problem determines printing surfaces for the given structure. If the proportion of unprintable elements isn't satisfactory, a second re-optimisation step is carried out to further reduce the unprintable proportion. Several examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Notably, the significant performance sacrifice associated with the 3-axis AM approach becomes negligible when applying our multi-axis AM-based method.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a topology optimization approach to design support structures with efficient thermal conductive capabilities for powder-bed based laser additive manufacturing (AM). A transient heat transfer model is proposed to simulate the temperature distribution of the point-by-point and layer-upon-layer AM process. The process model is seamlessly integrated into a density based structural topology optimization method with an adjoint based sensitivity analysis and a gradient based optimization. For a given prototype shape, the layout of the corresponding support structure is designed such that the thermal energy during the fabrication process can be efficiently transferred from the laser path to a prescribed heat sink. Besides, an overhang constraint is proposed and used together with an AM filter to avoid overhang features in both the optimized support structure and the prototype, ensuring the overall manufacturability. Numerical examples and discussions are given to demonstrate its applicability.},
