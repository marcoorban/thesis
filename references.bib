  abstract = {This paper applies topology optimisation to the design of structures with periodic and layered microstructural details without length scale separation, i.e. considering the complete macroscopic structure and its response, while resolving all microstructural details, as compared to the often used homogenisation approach. The approach takes boundary conditions into account and ensures connected and macroscopically optimised microstructures regardless of the difference in micro- and macroscopic length scales. This results in microstructures tailored for specific applications rather than specific properties. Manufacturability is further ensured by the use of robust topology optimisation. Dealing with the complete macroscopic structure and its response is computationally challenging as very fine discretisations are needed in order to resolve all microstructural details. Therefore, this paper shows the benefits of applying a contrast-independent spectral preconditioner based on the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) to large structures with fully-resolved microstructural details. It is shown that a single preconditioner can be reused for many design iterations and used for several design realisations, in turn leading to massive savings in computational cost. The density-based topology optimisation approach combined with a Heaviside projection filter and a stochastic robust formulation is used on various problems, with both periodic and layered microstructures. The presented approach is shown to allow for the topology optimisation of very large problems in Matlab, specifically a problem with 26 million displacement degrees of freedom in 26 hours using a single computational thread.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization of structures is nowadays a well developed field with many different approaches and a wealth of applications. One of the earliest methods of topology optimization was the so-called homogenization method, introduced in the early eighties. It became extremely popular in its over-simplified version, called SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation), which retains only the notion of material density and forgets about true composite materials with optimal (possibly non isotropic) microstructures. However, the appearance of mature additive manufacturing technologies which are able to build finely graded microstructures (sometimes called lattice materials) drastically change the picture and one can see a resurrection of the homogenization method for such applications. Indeed, homogenization is the right technique to deal with microstructured materials where anisotropy plays a key role, a feature which is absent from SIMP. Homogenization theory allows to replace the microscopic details of the structure (typically a complex networks of bars, trusses and plates) by a simpler effective elasticity tensor describing the mesoscopic properties of the structure. The goal of these lecture notes is to review the necessary mathematical tools of homogenization theory and apply them to topology optimization of mechanical structures. The ultimate application, targeted here, is the topology optimization of structures built with lattice materials. Practical and numerical exercises are given, based on the finite element free software FreeFem++.},

  abstract = {In additive manufacturing process, support structures are often required to ensure the quality of the final built part. In this article, we present mathematical models and their numerical implementations in an optimization loop, which allow us to design optimal support structures. Our models are derived with the requirement that they should be as simple as possible, computationally cheap, and, yet, based on a realistic physical modelling. Supports are optimized with respect to two different physical properties. First, they must support overhanging regions of the structure for improving the stiffness of the supported structure during the building process. Second, supports can help in channeling the heat flux produced by the source term (typically a laser beam) and thus improving the cooling down of the structure during the fabrication process. Of course, more involved constraints or manufacturability conditions could be taken into account, most notably removal of supports. Our work is just a first step, proposing a general framework for support optimization. Our optimization algorithm is based on the level set method and on the computation of shape derivatives by the Hadamard method. In a first approach, only the shape and topology of the supports are optimized, for a given and fixed structure. In a second and more elaborated strategy, both the supports and the structure are optimized, which amounts to a specific multiphase optimization problem. Numerical examples are given in 2D and 3D.},

The main novelty of our work is, in a plane setting, the conformal treatment of the optimal orientation of the microstructure. In other words, although the periodicity cell has varying parameters and orientation throughout the computational domain, the angles between its members or bars are conserved. The main application of our work is the optimization of so-called lattice materials which are becoming increasingly popular in the context of additive manufacturing.

A segmentation strategy for the support structure addition is proposed and evaluated in different configurations for ledge overhangs to reduce the amount of support structures without affecting the overhang accuracy. Based on the inferences of this study, design rules are proposed for producing overhang structures through electron beam melting. The results identified the self-supporting limits for different overhang geometries.

This paper presents a methodology for optimal shape design where both these drawbacks can be avoided. The method is related to modern production techniques and consists of computing the optimal distribution in space of an anisotropic material that is constructed by introducing an infimum of periodically distributed small holes in a given homogeneous, isotropic material, with the requirement that the resulting structure can carry the given loads as well as satisfy other design requirements. The computation of effective material properties for the anisotropic material is carried out using the method of homogenization. Computational results are presented and compared with results obtained by boundary variations.},

Every point in space is thus a material point or a void and the optimization problem is a discrete variable one. This paper describes various ways of removing this discrete nature of the problem by the introduction of a density function that is a continuous design variable. Domains of high density then define the shape of the mechanical element. For intermediate densities, material parameters given by an artificial material law can be used. Alternatively, the density can arise naturally through the introduction of periodically distributed, microscopic voids, so that effective material parameters for intermediate density values can be computed through homogenization. Several examples in two-dimensional elasticity illustrate that these methods allow a determination of the topology of a mechanical element, as required for a boundary variations shape optimization technique.},

  abstract = {Dual optimization algorithms are well suited for the topology design of continuum structures in discrete variables, since in these problems the number of constraints is small in comparison to the number of design variables. The ‘raw’ dual algorithm, which was originally proposed for the minimum compliance design problem, worked well when a perimeter constraint was added in addition to the volume constraint. However, if the perimeter constraint was gradually relaxed by increasing the upper bound on the allowable perimeter, the algorithm tended to behave erratically. Recently, a simple strategy has been suggested which modifies the raw dual algorithm to make it more robust in the absence of the perimeter constraint; in particular the problem of checkerboarding which is frequently observed with the use of lower-order finite elements is eliminated. In this work, we show how the perimeter constraint can be incorporated in this improved algorithm, so that it not only provides a designer with a control over the topology, but also generates good topologies irrespective of the value of the upper bound on the perimeter.

  abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising additive manufacturing (AM) technique that has the potential to produce almost any three-dimensional (3D) metallic parts with complicated structures. During the SLM process, the thermal behavior of metal powder plays a significant role in maintaining the product quality during 3D printing. Furthermore, due to high heating and cooling rates within the selective laser melting (SLM) process, a high-temperature gradient forms in the heat-affected zone, which generates significant residual stresses within the fabricated parts. In this study, a thermo-mechanical coupling model was developed for studying thermal behavior, residual stress, and deformation during the SLM process of Ti6Al4V alloy. In the experiments, a TELOPS FAST-IR (M350) thermal imager was applied to determine the temperature profile of the melting pool and powder bed along the scanning direction during the SLM fabrication using Ti6Al4V powder. The numerically calculated results were compared with the experimentally determined temperature distribution. The comparison showed that the calculated peak temperature for single track by the developed thermal model was in good agreement with the experiment results. Through the simulation, an effective prediction method for investigating the effects of process parameters such as the laser power and scanning speed on the temperature distribution, residual stress, and deformation was established. The findings showed that the development of residual stress on the fabricated parts gradually increased throughout the SLM process, produced by a heat accumulation effect.},

Owing to the recent advances in additive manufacturing technology, TO has been developed in connection with the use of microscale lattices, of which complicated geometries require considerable computational loads to verify their structural performance. This study aims to develop an efficient computational method to analyze a complex TO model. Computational homogenization was then developed for efficient computation of the TO model that contains a number of microscale lattices. The proposed homogenization scheme was then applied to perform three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) on various TO models with three scales (i.e., macroscale, microscale, and multiscale TOs). The homogenized FEAs were conducted to verify the static and dynamic deformation behaviors of three optimized meta-sandwich beams, and their results and computational efficiency were compared with those from full solid FEAs. Experimental verification revealed that the proposed homogenized FEA provided more reliable results and better computational efficiency for the microscale and multiscale TO models, whereas the conventional solid FEA was advantageous for the macroscale TO model. To apply the proposed simulation strategy to a more complex 3D geometry, three TO models were calculated for a 3D block under a compression load. The simulation strategy combining the full solid and homogenized FEAs was then applied to analyze the static and dynamic deformation behaviors of various TO models, which provided reliable predictions of the experimentally observed behaviors within an acceptable computational time.},

Functionally graded composites are inhomogeneous materials with continuously varying spatial composition. The spatial variation in material properties might enable better performance than an isotropic multi-material structure or fiber-reinforced composite structure with fixed fiber volume fraction. In order to enable the simultaneous design of composite topology, spatially varying fiber material layout and orientation, a homogenization design method (HDM) is applied together with a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method taking into account the advantage of each method. The SIMP method is efficient in determining discrete material states while avoiding intermediate states. Thus, it is applied to determine whether a material is void or a composite state. The HDM allows intermediate material states because it considers true anisotropic composite materials. Taking this advantage, the HDM method is applied to optimize spatially varying anisotropic fiber material layout and orientation. The optimization result of the fiber material is visualized using the projection method proposed for periodic composite structures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical examples for compliance minimization problems are provided.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to consider uncertainties in the distortion prediction of additive manufacturing processes within robust topology optimization. The random variable of the stochastic additive manufacturing process is the inherent thermomechanical strain, typically determined by process characterization experiments. The value of the inherent strain per se encompasses uncertainty due to differences between characterization and production geometries, uncontrolled process variations, hatching pattern choices, and other effects not captured in layer-by-layer part-scale additive manufacturing simulation. These effects can be represented by different inherent strains for each realized layer, therefore, model the variability in part distortion. Instead of employing a more detailed simulation approach, requiring significantly more process data and computation time, our method aims at generating a robust design in this setting, to obtain parts exhibiting reduced distortion regardless of uncertainties in distortion prediction. The formulation benefits from the superposition potential within the employed process simulation. For robust optimization, the expected part distortion and its estimated variance are included in the standard density-based topology optimization algorithm’s objective function. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by simultaneously optimizing structural performance combined with a minimized additive manufacturing part distortion under uncertain process conditions.},

This offers exciting opportunities for innovative designs, and particularly topology optimization has been identified as a key technique to fully exploit the capabilities of AM. However, also AM involves manufacturing restrictions, such as limitations on the inclination of overhanging parts. To deal with this problem, either sacrificial supporting structures can be added during the process, or only self-supporting designs can be considered. Both approaches have disadvantages, as support structures add material and post-processing costs, while demanding exclusively self-supporting designs may impose strong restrictions on achievable performance. With current methods, designers are limited to a choice between these two extremes. To open up a wider range of designs, this paper presents and demonstrates a topology optimization formulation that allows the designer to find trade-off solutions between design performance and support structure costs, considering both printing and removal costs},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to apply a Helmholtz-type partial differential equation as an alternative to standard density filtering in topology optimization problems. Previously, this approach has been successfully applied as a sensitivity filter. The usual filtering techniques in topology optimization require information about the neighbor cells, which is difficult to obtain for fine meshes or complex domains and geometries. The complexity of the problem increases further in parallel computing, when the design domain is decomposed into multiple non-overlapping partitions. Obtaining information from the neighbor subdomains is an expensive operation. The proposed filter technique requires only mesh information necessary for the finite element discretization of the problem. The main idea is to define the filtered variable implicitly as a solution of a Helmholtz-type differential equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The properties of the filter are demonstrated for various 2D and 3D topology optimization problems in linear elasticity, solved on serial and parallel computers.

  abstract = {Topology optimization techniques are typically performed on a design domain with pre-determined support conditions to generate efficient structures. Allowing the optimizer to simultaneously design supports and topology offers new design possibilities to achieve improved structural performance and reduce the cost of supports. However, existing simultaneous optimization techniques are limited, with most methods requiring cumbersome procedures to pre-define support conditions, which may not be easy for the end-users. This study presents a new element-based simultaneous optimization method by introducing a layer of elements to the boundaries where supports are allowed, which can be simply implemented in finite element (FE) models. Computational algorithms are developed based on a combination of an optimality criteria (OC) method and the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique to determine support locations and the structural topology, respectively. A variety of examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. It is found that the number, position, and stiffness of supports may significantly influence the structural topology. A support location analysis is used to validate the new method and confirms optimal designs. This study shows that treating element-based support locations as additional design variables can effectively obtain efficient and innovative structural designs. Two 3D examples are presented to demonstrate potential practical applications of the new method.},

A total of 154,553 patients obtained primary TKR surgery between 1996 and 2010. The diagnosis code for knee OA and the procedure code for TKR were selected from the records. To compare the rate of TKR between covariables, we calculated the TKR risk ratios and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of these variables (gender, age, age group, and primary diagnoses). A 2-tailed P-value of .05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical package SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to conduct all the statistical analyzes. We analyzed 154,553 TKRs performed by surgeons in Taiwan from 1996 to 2010. The overall crude incidence increased from 26.4 to 74.55 TKR per 100,000 inhabitants from 1996 to 2010. TKR incidence for the 70 to 79 years age group increased from 227 to 505 per 100,000 people from 1996 to 2010. The age-standardized rate ratios for TKR of women to men ranged from 2.5 to 3.0. The mean average length of stay in hospital was 15 days in 1996 and decreased to 8 days in 2010. During the study period, the adjusted mean cost per patient decreased from US\$7485 to US\$4827. Health expenditures for TKR were 5\% of total National Health Insurance expenditure every year. Over the 15-year period, Taiwan's TKR incidence tripled, which is consistent with population ageing. Arthritis will be a major public health issue in the ageing population in the future.},

Laser powder bed fusion is one of the popular techniques used to fabricate metal parts. However, it induces residual stress and distortion during fabrication that adversely affects the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the manufactured parts. Therefore, predicting and avoiding the residual stress and distortion are critical issues. In this study, we propose a topology optimization method that accounts for the distortion. First, we propose a computationally inexpensive analytical model for additive manufacturing that uses laser powder bed fusion and formulated an optimization problem. Next, we approximate the topological derivative of the objective function using an adjoint variable method that is then utilized to update the level set function via a time evolutionary reaction-diffusion equation. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method was established using two-dimensional design examples.},

In this paper, Additive Manufacturing simulations are coupled with Topology Optimization in order to generate designs that are not susceptible to failure associated with distortion. Two possible causes of failure are accounted for: recoater collision and global distortion of the product. Both are considered by simulation of the build process and defined as constraints in the context of a Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization method based topological optimization. The adjoint method is used to derive the sensitivities of the additive manufacturing constraints. The method is demonstrated with the 2D and 3D optimization of a bracket. Next to global topological changes, the obtained designs show features that are aimed at facilitating the printing process. These features resemble supports that are routinely applied to powder bed additive manufacturing. The formulated constraints were found to prevent excessive part distortion and associated build failures in all cases, against a modest increase in the compliance of the bracket.},

  abstract = {In this work, an in house topology optimization (TO) solver is developed to optimize a conjugate heat transfer problem: realizing more complex and efficient coolant systems by minimizing pressure losses and maximizing the heat transfer. The TO method consists in an idealized sedimentation process in which a design variable, in this case impermeability, is iteratively updated across the domain. The optimal solution is the solidified region uniquely defined by the final distribution of impermeability. Due to the geometrical complexity of the optimal solutions obtained, this design method is not always suitable for classic manufacturing methods (molding, stamping....) On the contrary, it can be thought as an approach to better and fully exploit the flexibility offered by additive manufacturing (AM), still often used on old and less efficient design techniques. In the present article, the proposed method is developed using a Lagrangian optimization approach to minimize stagnation pressure dissipation while maximizing heat transfer between fluid and solid region. An impermeability dependent thermal conductivity is included and a smoother operator is adopted to bound thermal diffusivity gradients across solid and fluid. Simulations are performed on a straight squared duct domain. The variability of the results is shown on the basis of different weights of the objective functions. The solver builds automatically three-dimensional structures enhancing the heat transfer level between the walls and the flow through the generation of pairs of counter rotating vortices. This is consistent to solution proposed in literature like v-shaped ribs, even if the geometry generated is more complex and more efficient. It is possible to define the desired level of heat transfer and losses and obtain the closest optimal solution. It is the first time that a conjugate heat transfer optimization problem, with these constraints, has been tackled with this approach for three-dimensional geometries.},

  abstract = {Commodity thermoplastics and thermoplastic composites are staples in Additive Manufacturing (AM). Their use is widespread and accounts for the largest volume of 3D printed materials. Accessible property ranges of current material formulations are limited, and thus there is high interest in extending AM to high-performance engineering polymers and nanocomposites that have yet to gain wide commercial acceptance in AM. Current applications of high-performance thermoplastic polymers are limited to adaptations from conventional plastics processing such as injection molding, thermoforming, extrusion, and others. Thermoplastic composites can be categorized into particle-, fiber-, and nanomaterial-based composites as well as polymer blends. The importance of these different composite systems to AM is discussed in this review. Also reviewed are trends in instrument development such as in-nozzle impregnation, dual print heads, and higher temperature FDM that improve printing of thermoplastic composites. An overview of newer types of AM techniques allowing higher filler loading for thermoplastic composites like liquid deposition modeling (LDM) sometimes known as direct ink writing (DIW) are discussed. Finally, a perspective is given on the important parameters and standards needed to make AM printed objects from polymer composites more effective in cost/performance ratio.},

The drawback of these techniques has been gray transition regions between solid and void parts, but this problem has recently been alleviated using various projection methods. In this paper we show that simple projection methods do not ensure local mesh-convergence and propose a modified robust topology optimization formulation based on erosion, intermediate and dilation projections that ensures both global and local mesh-convergence.},

Multiple additive manufacturing issues are considered and overcome with the proposed method, including the self-support issue, minimum length scale control, and support structure easy removal. Specifically, a finite element analysis model based on the inherent strain method is proposed to simulate the complex mechanical behavior in the additive manufacturing process. Then, according to the layer-by-layer inherent strain-based fast simulation model, the gravity compliance and residual distortion minimization topology optimization problem incorporating the self-support constraint, mass fraction constraint, minimum length-scale control, and support easy-removal constraint is formulated. Accordingly the critical sensitivity information is derived through the adjoint analysis. Finally, the proposed method is applied to several 2D and 3D benchmark examples to demonstrate the effectiveness on residual distortion control. The influences of different optimization strategies, weighting parameters, and minimum length-scale limits are comparatively explored. A comprehensive discussion is presented at the end to summarize the numerical phenomena.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Although additive manufacturing (AM) continues to gain widespread adoption, the overhang problem remains a critical issue affecting printing quality. The design of self-supporting structures via topology optimisation approaches has been extensively studied. However, current optimisation research predominantly focuses on 3-axis AM machines, overlooking the more recently developed multi-axis machines. Moreover, the performance sacrifice due to overhang constraints in 3-axis AM can be significant, especially in structures with small volume fractions. To address this, we propose a two-step approach considering overhang constraints for multi-axis AM. This approach begins with a structure optimised using traditional topology optimisation. In the first step, a new optimisation problem determines printing surfaces for the given structure. If the proportion of unprintable elements isn't satisfactory, a second re-optimisation step is carried out to further reduce the unprintable proportion. Several examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Notably, the significant performance sacrifice associated with the 3-axis AM approach becomes negligible when applying our multi-axis AM-based method.},

Meanwhile, unprintable V-shaped areas caused by polygon intersections are gradually eliminated through polygon modifications and re-optimization.

  abstract = {Owing to the rapid development in additive manufacturing, the potential to fabricate intricate structures has become a reality, emphasizing the importance of designing structures conducive to additive manufacturing processes. A crucial consideration is the ability to design structures requiring no additional support during manufacturing. This paper employs implicit B-spline representations for self-supporting structure design by integrating a topology optimization model with self-supporting constraints derived analytically from the implicit representation. This analytical derivation for detecting overhang regions enables accurate and efficient calculation of constraints, outperforming other B-spline-based methods. Compared to the traditional voxel-based methods, the implicit B-spline representation significantly expedites the optimization process by reducing the number of design variables. Additionally, several acceleration techniques are implemented to enhance the efficiency of our method, allowing simulations of 3D models with millions of finite elements to be completed within one and half an hour, excelling other B-spline-based methods and voxel-based methods. Various numerical experiments validate its excellent performance, confirming the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

The process model is seamlessly integrated into a density based structural topology optimization method with an adjoint based sensitivity analysis and a gradient based optimization. For a given prototype shape, the layout of the corresponding support structure is designed such that the thermal energy during the fabrication process can be efficiently transferred from the laser path to a prescribed heat sink. Besides, an overhang constraint is proposed and used together with an AM filter to avoid overhang features in both the optimized support structure and the prototype, ensuring the overall manufacturability. Numerical examples and discussions are given to demonstrate its applicability.},
