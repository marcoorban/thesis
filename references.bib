  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to apply a Helmholtz-type partial
              differential equation as an alternative to standard density
              filtering in topology optimization problems. Previously, this
              approach has been successfully applied as a sensitivity filter. The
              usual filtering techniques in topology optimization require
              information about the neighbor cells, which is difficult to obtain
              for fine meshes or complex domains and geometries. The complexity
              of the problem increases further in parallel computing, when the
              design domain is decomposed into multiple non-overlapping
              partitions. Obtaining information from the neighbor subdomains is
              an expensive operation. The proposed filter technique requires only
              mesh information necessary for the finite element discretization of
              the problem. The main idea is to define the filtered variable
              implicitly as a solution of a Helmholtz-type differential equation
              with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The properties of the
              filter are demonstrated for various 2D and 3D topology optimization
              problems in linear elasticity, solved on serial and parallel
              computers. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Total knee replacement (TKR) is considered as one of the most
              success among clinical interventions for patients with who
              suffering from knee osteoarthritis (OA). We sought to estimate the
              incidence of TKR using demographics, incidence rates, lengths of
              hospital stay, and costs from 1996 to 2010 by analyzing Taiwan's
              National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 154,553
              patients obtained primary TKR surgery between 1996 and 2010. The
              diagnosis code for knee OA and the procedure code for TKR were
              selected from the records. To compare the rate of TKR between
              covariables, we calculated the TKR risk ratios and 95\% confidence
              interval (CI) of these variables (gender, age, age group, and
              primary diagnoses). A 2-tailed P-value of .05 was considered
              statistically significant. The statistical package SPSS version
              20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to conduct all the statistical
              analyzes. We analyzed 154,553 TKRs performed by surgeons in Taiwan
              from 1996 to 2010. The overall crude incidence increased from 26.4
              to 74.55 TKR per 100,000 inhabitants from 1996 to 2010. TKR
              incidence for the 70 to 79 years age group increased from 227 to
              505 per 100,000 people from 1996 to 2010. The age-standardized rate
              ratios for TKR of women to men ranged from 2.5 to 3.0. The mean
              average length of stay in hospital was 15 days in 1996 and
              decreased to 8 days in 2010. During the study period, the adjusted
              mean cost per patient decreased from US\$7485 to US\$4827. Health
              expenditures for TKR were 5\% of total National Health Insurance
              expenditure every year. Over the 15-year period, Taiwan's TKR
              incidence tripled, which is consistent with population ageing.
              Arthritis will be a major public health issue in the ageing
              population in the future.},

  abstract = {The use of additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has progressed
              beyond prototyping to produce intricate and valuable finished
              goods. The potential of additive manufacturing has increased across
              numerous industries due to the expansion of materials, such as
              high-performance metals and polymers, and advancements in machine
              capabilities, such as multi-material printing. By enabling complex
              designs, reduced waste, and quick production, it has the potential
              to revolutionize the consumer goods, healthcare, automotive
              manufacturing, and aerospace industries. The development of
              specialized scaffolds has been made possible by the precise control
              that additive manufacturing provides over the internal structure of
              porous materials. This technology has revolutionized tissue
              engineering and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, it has made it
              possible to create individualized implants and prosthetics that
              improve patient comfort and outcomes in orthopedic and dental
              applications. Also, it provides flexibility in design and
              customization for individualized implants and prosthetics in
              orthopedic and dental applications. Design flexibility, waste
              reduction, improved biocompatibility, quick prototyping, and
              cost-effectiveness are benefits of additive manufacturing for
              implants. For personalized healthcare, regenerative medicine, and
              better patient outcomes, additive manufacturing holds promise as
              the technology develops with further advancements in printing speed
